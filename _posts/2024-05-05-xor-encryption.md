## Mini Essay on XOR Encryption

XOR is a logical operation , it stands for exclusive OR.

A while back (few monthgs), I watched a youtube video where someone was implementing this in C so i took a challenge to implement same in python as i am starting to learn it more deeply and from the first fundamentals

This project helped me to get a deeper understanding of how to open , close and write files properly in Python and how to use the secrets library which is inbuilt into python

XOR accepts both the operands to be of same length and same data type which was a setback but eventually i came across a similar solution where the guy was repeating the key such that it of the same length.
